      <h2><u>INTEREST IN IT</u></h2>
    </a>
    <p><b><i>What is your interest in IT? When did your interest in IT start? Was there a particular event or person that sparked your interest?</i></b>
    <ul>
      <li>When you live so much of your life on the Internet, deriving your entertainment, your income, and a large portion of your social life online,
        it’s easy to get invested in the world of IT. I’m interested in the technologies we use to stay connected with one another,
        as well as how these can be used to change the way in which we create and consume entertainment, from music to gaming.
        I’m also interested in the infrastructures that allow us to live within a technological society.</li>
      <li>My interest in IT began when I was young. I remember playing these old disc-based games on a super outdated, clunky laptop in the Philippines
        before the Internet established its ubiquity within the world,
        before eventually spending the rest of my childhood in Australia exploring all of the flash games the Internet afforded me.</li>
    </ul>
    </p>
    <p><b><i>Outline your IT experience (if any).</i></b><br><br>
      I’ve done some basic courses on HTML/CSS in between studying my first degree and working, but most of my formal IT exposure will be coming
      from this course. I did do volunteer work as part of a development team for an online game as a writer, and worked alongside programmers and coders.
    </p>
    <p><b><i>Why did you choose to come to RMIT?</i></b><br><br>
      I chose RMIT as they were the ones who offered the COVID short course. I’ve also heard good things about the university, so I wanted to check it out.
    </p>
    <p><b><i>What do you expect to learn during your studies?</i></b><br><br>
      I look forward to immersing myself more into the IT world beyond cursory looks into it (as in, studying a few HTML/CSS courses).
      By dedicating more of my time into learning something I’ve had an interest in for a while, I hope to learn more about what it means to develop a website,
      program your own projects, user design/experience, and create and maintain databases!

      <h2><u>IDEAL JOB</u></h2>
    </a>
    <p>The position I've selected as my ideal job is one where <b class="specificbold">you’re responsible for developing, implementing and managing
        the High Court’s Microsoft and cloud-based systems,</b> specifically comprising of the Digital Lodgement System and the Electronic Court File.
      This role in particular appeals to me because it sits right in the middle of the intersection between two areas of interest that
      I would love to fuse into a career one day: the legal system and IT.
      A role that seems as if it’s geared towards improving the efficiency of the High Court’s inner operations
      sounds like it would do a great deal of service for the public.</p>

    <p>This role requires that the applicant is proficient working with and has a comprehensive knowledge
      of Microsoft and Cloud-based programs, specifically: <b class="specificbold">Microsoft Dynamics 365, Azure, Office 365, Microsoft Power Automate, and SharePoint Online.</b></p>
    <p>This role also requires that the applicant has general IT expertise and know-how,
      presumably from having years of experience and working in different IT sectors, to be effective in planning out and following through
      with future strategies for innovating the High Court’s current systems.</p>
    <br>
    <hr class="golddots">

    <p><b><i>My current IT skill-set:</i></b></p>

    <p>Beyond having a proficiency working with Microsoft Office 365
      and general IT know-how from living and growing up with evolving technology, I don’t possess
      that degree of specialised IT knowledge that would allow me to succeed in this role.</p>

    <p><b><i>My roadmap for attaining similar roles:</i></b></p>

    <p>To better prepare myself for roles such as this,
      I would continue on with this degree to heighten my IT proficiency, and aim for entry-level IT jobs before progressing further.
      Along the way, I hope to come across these different Microsoft and cloud-based programs and have the opportunity
      to either learn how to use them, and/or gain practical experience in using them.</p>

    </a>
    <h3>Myers-Briggs test results: <b class="specificbold"><u>INFP-T</u></b></h3>
    <p><b><i>What do the results of these tests mean for you?</i></b></p>
    <p>Though I don’t put much weight into the results of personality tests, as they lack a bit of nuance
      in their attempt to try and condense someone’s personality, it’s still interesting to know what sort of role I would be classified as.
      Many of the descriptors of what a Mediator (INFP) is aligns with how I perceive myself, how I conduct myself, and what I believe in!
      <br><br>
      Strengths attributed to Mediators, such as being driven, passionate, and skilled communicators, are ones
      I believe I also possess, as my quiet disposition tends to hide how dedicated I can be when it comes to my work,
      how deeply I stand by my values, and my love for written communication. Some of the weaknesses attributed to Mediators,
      however, such as being too idealistic or stretching myself too thin to cater for others, I also see in myself,
      and are certainly areas for improvement. Other weaknesses such as Mediators disliking working with data and facts I diverge from.</p>
    <p><b><i>How do you think these results may influence your behaviour in a team?</i></b></p>
    <p>I think these results more so describe how I fit in within a team rather than influence my behaviour in one!
      I tend to immerse myself in group projects and get super involved, wanting to start early and keep ahead of schedule so that the job gets done.
      I work well with others by involving them in the project, listening to their ideas and opinions and balancing them so that everyone’s voices
      gets heard, and being flexible with the outcome of the project to satisfy everyone’s visions.</p>
    <p><b><i>How should you take this into account when forming a team?</i></b></p>
    <p>I’d love to form a team that would share the same work ethic I do, who would meet me halfway and put in the effort rather than being complacent
      and letting everyone else carry them to a good result. I’d love to work with people who are equally dedicated, committed,
      and want to get the job done to the best standard without exploiting the hard-working quality of any member in the group.</p>

      <h3>Online learning style test results: <b class="specificbold"><u>audiovisual learner</b></u></h3>
      <p><b><i>What do the results of these tests mean for you?</i></b></p>
      <p>I think these results are quite accurate and very much align with how I learn best! I’m very much an audiovisual learner over a hands-on learner.
        I like learning the theory behind something and understanding it at that level (like watching a video on how to do something and reading transcripts,
        reading instructions or set readings for the week, or memorising something whilst listening to music) rather than immediately jumping to
        more practical work and learning as you go.</p>
      <p><b><i>How do you think these results may influence your behaviour in a team?</i></b></p>
      <p>I don’t believe these results will have much of an impact! If anything, it would be helpful for me to be transparent with how best I learn,
        and ask for information regarding a project to be sent in text so I can read and process the information that way, or in a voice mail/video that I can listen/watch.</p>
      <p><b><i>How should you take this into account when forming a team?</i></b></p>
      <p>I’d take this into account by hopefully forming a team with people who either learn in similar ways I do,
        or with people who are aware that people learn and process information differently, and can accomodate accordingly.</p>

    <h3>Emotional intelligence online test results: <b class="specificbold"><u>high EI</u></b></h3>
    <p><b><i>What do the results of these tests mean for you?</i></b></p>
    <p>It’s surprising, but is pleasing to know. It’s nice ranking highly in a skill that comes naturally to me, whilst being very valuable in environments that
      involves working with other people. I value my ability to discern how people are feeling, to read the room, to recognise difference in others,
      and to know how to deal with adversity that may arise, and is not qualities to be complacent about! To better prepare myself for future obstacles and opportunities,
      I aim to improve myself on these fronts and hone my skills.</p>
    <p><b><i>How do you think these results may influence your behaviour in a team?</i></b></p>
    <p>I don’t believe it would change much about how I behave in a team. I would continue acting how I normally would in group settings:
      focusing on the common goal, sharing my ideas while remaining thoughtful by listening to others’ ideas to find if there’s a common ground,
      and stepping in and mediating should conflicts arise.</p>
    <p><b><i>How should you take this into account when forming a team?</i></b></p>
    <p>I would love to work with people who are similar as I am in this regard, flexible individuals who are considerate of others and able to
      navigate differences and willing to work through them. Team members who are able to meet you halfway or willing to work alongside you are valuable
      and essential to the success of a group-based project.</p>

        <h2> <u>PROJECT IDEA: Increasing the Accessibility of Legal Services</u> </h2>
      </a>
      <p>
      <h3>Overview</h3>
      </p>
      <p>In the same vein as similar initiatives (such as the <a href="https://www.legalaid.nsw.gov.au/get-legal-help/legal-aid-nsw-app">Legal Aid NSW application</a> and the <a href="https://www.gotocourt.com.au/legal-news/legal-advice-app/">Go To
          Court application</a>) that aim to close gaps in accessing justice, my project will be the creation of a
        mobile application that focuses on aggregating different legal services available within Victoria, as well as providing general resources for Victorians to learn about the law.
        In order to achieve this, <a href="https://dotnet.microsoft.com/apps/xamarin">Xamarin</a>, an open source tool, will be used to create a mobile application that will work on both iOS and Android devices.
        Successfully completing this project will result in an easily accessible mobile application that places legal assistance and guidance in the pockets of Victorians,
        reducing the barriers that people (especially disadvantaged Victorians) face when it comes to navigating the justice system.</p></a>
    </section>

    <br>
    <hr class="golddots">
    <br>

    <p>
    <h3>Motivation</h3>
    </p>
    <p>I believe that using technology will be instrumental in removing the factors that hinder people from accessing the justice system, particularly vulnerable and disadvantaged Victorians.
      Having a free mobile application that anyone can install onto their phones means that legal services can be easily delivered to those who would best benefit from it,
      but perhaps may not be able to access them due to factors such as:
    <ul>
      <li>being unable to afford private legal representation</li>
      <li>living in rural areas where legal resources are limited</li>
      <li>not knowing where to look for legal advice, not being able to consult someone for legal advice, or not being able to understand legal advice given</li>
    </ul>
    As such, I hope this mobile application proves particularly beneficial to Victorians affected by these factors.</p>

    <br>
    <hr class="golddots">
    <br>

    <p>
    <h3>Description</h3>
    </p>
    <p>This mobile application will place different legal service providers, as well as being a resource for accessing general information about Victorian law, in one central place.
      As such, the features of the application include:
      <br><br>
      <i>Allowing users to find a community legal centre (CLC) near them</i>

    <ul>
      <li>This will involve being able to enter in a user’s location (using either a phone’s GPS functions or inputting in a location manually.</li>
      <li>The contact details, the address and directions to each CLC (using something like Google Maps) will be displayed.</li>
    </ul>

    <i>A dedicated section for <a href="https://www.legalaid.vic.gov.au">Victoria Legal Aid</a> and its resources</i>

    <ul>
      <li>Users can call-in directly to Victoria Legal Aid’s phone services to get legal advice by clicking on hyperlinked numbers.</li>
      <li>Users can apply for lawyers that can represent them at court as well as facilitating applications for grants to help them afford legal representation.</li>
      <li>Users can also locate or contact a Victoria Legal Aid office near them.
        Much like the CLC function, users can find a Victoria Legal Aid office by inputting in a location or through their phone’s GPS, and be given the office’s address and contact details.</li>
    </ul>

    <i>A directory of lawyers and law firms that can be filtered to show the services that are relevant to the user’s needs</i>

    The directory will work as follows:

    <ul>
      <li>Each listing for a lawyer or law firm will show what area of law they specialise in, the locations their service covers, their contact details,
        a link to their website, and whether they offer pro-bono services or solely a private practice.</li>
      <li>The directory can be filtered to show only what the user is looking for. For example, if the user is only looking for pro-bono lawyers and law firms associated with them, only those listings will show up.
        Similarly, the user could also be looking for lawyers and law firms near them.</li>
    </ul>

    <i>A dedicated section for the <a href="http://vals.org.au">Victorian Aboriginal Legal Service (VALS)</a> for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples</i>

    <ul>
      <li>This feature will provide easy access to VALS’s 24-hour hotlines by hyperlinking the number, as well as other important contact details and addresses.</li>
      <li>There will also be general information about VALS and what their service does for the Indigenous community.</li>
    </ul>

    <i>A general repository for users to learn more about the law, in plain English and other languages to improve accessibility</i>

    <ul>
      <li>This can include more in-depth looks at the legal issues that people commonly encounter throughout their lives (like speeding tickets)
        and the process that's undergone when dealing with them, and the sanctions associated with them.</li>
      <li>This can also include insights as to your rights as a Victorian, such as your rights when it comes to dealing with police.</li>
      <li>The repository can support content presented in both text form and in video forms.</li>
    </ul>

    <i>An inquiry feature where users of the app can send queries regarding legal topics that are of interest to them and would like to know more about to legal practitioners or other legal experts who can answer them.</i>

    <ul>
      <li>The queries will not be answered in a rush to ensure for accuracy and be of a high quality, but will be answered in due time.</li>
    </ul>
    </p>

    <br>
    <hr class="golddots">

    <p>
    <h3>Tools and Technologies</h3>
    </p>
    <p>As I intend to make an application that works for both iOS and Android devices, a tool that facilitates for cross-platform development is essential.
      For this purpose, I’ve chosen <a href="https://dotnet.microsoft.com/apps/xamarin">Xamarin</a>, an open source tool that combines C# and .NET to create applications for the OS of your choice.
      I would require a desktop through which I can run Xamarin and begin creating the application, as well as having an iOS device and an Android device so I can test the application in the future.</p>

    <br>
    <hr class="golddots">

    <p>
    <h3>Skills Required</h3>
    </p>
    <p>Acquiring the software and hardware for this project, notably installing and running the necessary programs like Visual Studio, Xcode and SDKs on my desktop, is quite straightforward and feasible.
      The more difficult portion, however, is learning how to use these resources to make a functional mobile application.
      Though Xamarin seems to have many tutorials for beginners and provides extensive support, I would still need to write the coding behind the application.
      As such, I think it would be beneficial to have some familiarity with C# and .NET, which is feasible, but will certainly take some time to achieve.</p>

    <br>
    <hr class="golddots">

    <p>
    <h3>Outcome</h3>
    </p>
    <p>If the project is successful, the end result is a mobile application that extends the precedent for mobile-based legal resources to Victoria.
      With this application, I hope that the barriers to justice that Victorians face are dissolved because these legal services, advice and resources fits neatly in their pockets at no cost to them to access.
      I hope that the success of this project will inspire others to utilise technology to lift up and help others so that they too may be treated fairly in the eyes of the law, and exercise the rights afforded to all.</p>
